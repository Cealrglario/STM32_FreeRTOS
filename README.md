# An STM32 Development Board running on FreeRTOS
This repository is for the implementation of FreeRTOS on an STM32 development board. 

In its early stages, it will be used to learn about FreeRTOS concepts like semaphores, scheduling, message queues, etc.

In the later stages, it will eventually culminate in a "final project", applying gathered knowledge to develop a functional embedded system with specific, practical functionality.
