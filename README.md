# An STM32 Development Board running on FreeRTOS
This repository is for the implementation of FreeRTOS on an STM32 development board. 

In its early stages, it will be used to learn about FreeRTOS concepts like semaphores, scheduling, message queues, etc., purposefully avoiding the use of a CMSIS-RTOS API to allow myself to become quite aquainted with the FreeRTOS API and its specific syntax and usage.

In the later stages, it will eventually culminate in a "final project", applying gathered knowledge to develop a functional embedded system with specific, practical functionality.
